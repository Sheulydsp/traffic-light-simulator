# 🚦 Traffic Light Simulator with Pedestrian Signals

A simple yet educational Python project that simulates a traffic light system with pedestrian signals using the Tkinter GUI library. This project demonstrates basic state transitions, pedestrian logic, and GUI drawing in Python.

## 🎯 Features

- North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) traffic lights with RED, YELLOW, GREEN states
- Pedestrian signals with emoji indicators (🚶‍♂️)
- Pedestrians can "walk" when traffic is stopped (green pedestrian signal)
- Intuitive and easy-to-understand visuals
- Start and Pause simulation buttons

## 🖼️ GUI Preview

> NS and EW traffic lights are shown in boxes. Pedestrian signals with emojis are placed clearly next to the respective light groups.
